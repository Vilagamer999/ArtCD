Yes - I am always taking commissions -<does a dance> if ya are interested email me some info and we can work something out to your liking, have  a peek at the prices below &mdash; all negotiable &mdash;
<br><br>

<b>finished pencils</b> -  from  $ 50 *<br>
<b>full color</b> - from  $ 75 *<br>

<br><br>
<b>Adopt a fox! Sponsors wanted!!!</b>
<br><br>
Yes, it has occurred that certain people (crazy crazy people) have consented to engage me for a set number of commissions there is a cost reduction in commissioning in bulk with me. Feel free to inquire about sponsorship today *hee
<br><br>
What I will and will not draw on a commission basis: Basically your imagination is the limit EXCEPT for a few out of bounds subjects.... Unpleasantness like rape, severe bondage, and filth like fecophilia, etc. are just out - but almost anything else you can come up with I will draw for you to the best of my abilities.
<br><br>
If you're not sure just drop me an email and we can talk about it.
<br><br>
Fennec reserves the right to refuse any commission request at his discretion.
<br><br>
Price may vary per complexity of a commission and number of characters involved, but I usually stay in the price range/s above.  What you get for your money also varies - if ya get pencils - I will send you a high quality back and grey scale print (very spiffy), of rink &mdash; same gig &mdash; (now here's the real deal) if ya getta color commission  ya get the COLOR ORIGINAL in a high scale rendering of your pic in full color on spiffy 100lb color paper *wee.
<br><br>
Files of your commission upon request for IBM compatible PCs, and web post posting at your request.
<br><br>

Payment in full upon approved first draft, to be sent to the address below.
<br><br>
Whew - *huff , huff - well, I think that's all the crap that I can spew for now (burp) So, if alla that didn't turn you off to the idea of a commission, then you know where you can reach me &mdash;
<br><br>
I look forward to bringing some of your fuzzy little fantasies to paper *giggles.
<br><br>
 *Scritches, later.
