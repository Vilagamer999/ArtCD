<h2>Equis Commission Info</h2>

<p class="left">
<b>General rules for commissions:</b><br>
<br>
I will not draw rape, snuff, or pieces involving underaged sex.
Sexual content is, of course, perfectly fine. If you're not sure about the content of your commission, then by all means ask.<br>
<br>
Commisions are generaly worked in whatever media suits my customer and I.
The more expensive the media, the more expensive the commission in the end.
Prices are also based on size, and complexity of the piece.<br>
<br>


<b>Basic price schedule:</b><br>
9" x 12" pencil : $30.00<br>
9" x 12" color (mixed media) : $45.00<br>
<br>
14.5" x 11" pencil : $60.00<br>
14.5 x 11" color (mixed media) : $75.00<br>
<br>
Pieces with color done in photoshop are priced according to complexity, and number of characters, etc.
If you want a larger size, or specific media, just ask, and we will work some thing out.
Please email me for an estimate on pieces of different sizes, or specific media.<br>
<br>

<b>Making a commission:</b><br>
To commission me to create a piece for you, <a href="mailto:equishorse@yahoo.com">email me</a>.
I will be quite happy to work with you. Please keep in mind that I am very busy,
and I draw slowly, so it may be awhile before I am finished with your piece.<br>
<br>
