<b>Suggestions for Aspiring Artists:</b>
<p class="para">Follow your dreams. You can make a difference. Beefcake.. BEEFCAKE!!
Oh wait... wrong rant.</p>
<p class="para">Aspiring Artists huh?  Draw.  Then when your done, Draw some more.
Hold it up to a mirror and correct anything that looks funny.
Figure out what area you're weakest in, and get better.  Figure out
what's slowing you down, and eliminate it.  Sign up for a few classes...
about DRAWING! And be sure to doodle in the margins of your book.
It's a drawing-class... the teacher is sure to appreciate the extra
work &gt;^_^&lt;.    Oh, most important part... get up... take a few deep
breaths and touch
your toes and stretch all around. Do a few warm-ups exercises...  Ok, now
sit your ass down and draw some more!</p>

<p class="para">Bleh.. I guess you want a serious answer huh?
Keep in mind this is opinion.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't criticize while you're drawing. Draw first, evaluate later.
Preferably, draw in bulk... 6 or 7 pages at a time, then go back and
examine them.</li>

<li>Every time your pencil touches paper (or in my case, pen touches
tablet) you don't
have to create a masterpiece. Do thumbnail sketches. Toy with the color
scheme.
Try to get an idea of what you want to do before you commit the time to
doing it.
Find an opportunity everyday to draw a little bit just for you! Play
dammit, this is supposed to be FUN!</li>

<li>Notice things.  The way the steam rolls off a hot mocha-latte. The
swirl of
seaweed in miso soup. Notice the way people walk, How they hold their
hands. How
they gesture when talking. Pay attention to everything around you.  When
you look
at a person, what stands out? Could you identify them in a crowd of
similarly dressed people? What makes them unique. Find out.</li>
</ol>

<b>Suggestions for Aspiring Furry-Artists:</b>
<p class="para">Anthropomorphism means giving human attributes to non-human things.
You'll need to have a pretty good idea of those human-traits before you
can
convincingly pass them on to another species.  Learn to draw humans. If
you
find you suck at it (and I don't mean suck like a fox), figure out why and
get better!</p>
