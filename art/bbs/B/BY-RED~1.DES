The by-char.jpg changed my thoughts about doing pictures on the 
computer (used to think it was too hard) and so I tried again
with this one.  It took quite long because I got bored.
It also isn't as smoothly colored as by-char.jpg because 
my computer is really slow and it was a much higher res (orig: 
740 X 850) pic than by-char.  But I think it's more detailed 
and has a more interesting pose than by-char.
And that's it for my long description file!
