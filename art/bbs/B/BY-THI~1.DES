Someone said they liked griffins alot so I drew one (on the 
computer) for them.
When they saw the original compu-sketch they said he looked like
he was thinking so I just based the picture on that old statue
of a man thinking.
17 days on and off developing this one until finish
Oh yeah, they said they liked griffins with "ears"
