This was an entry in a logo contest for a radio station
in Montgomery, AL that had to feature the morning show hosts Roe and Mitchel. The
station was 95.1 the Fox. The gag was to have thier names on the fox's t-shirt.
Get it...Roe and Mitchel on the Fox...get it?  I didn't finish it in time anyway.
