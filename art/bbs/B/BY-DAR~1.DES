I was trying to come up with a buddy for the trenchcoat 
character that has popped up twice before (by-red & by-char)
and so I came up with this guy.  Originally supposed to be a fox
he eventually became a wolf but I suppose he kinda looks foxish.
The gun aint so great, neither are his hands but oh well,  he's
pretty cool.
