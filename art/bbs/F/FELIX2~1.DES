It's Felix-Squared, MultiFurry's Mascot.  What?  You want a rundown?  Ok,
from the top:  Extra eye; siamese nose; extra chest & arms; extra pecs and
torso muscles; three tails; extra fingers; and yes, it's hard for him to
get any "action" (tastefully covered up)

Artist: Kelly Price/STriker RedWolf.  Grayscale.
