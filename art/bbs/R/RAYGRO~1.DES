This image is of a group of objects I have been working
on in Imagine.  Placed together with a star field background
The image looked decent enough to try uploading it.  The
characters/objects from left to right, back to front are as
follows: Furnexia body form, Bobcat upper torsle form, Monitor
front, Workbench (Amiga) lady with unbrella and Flashlight.
